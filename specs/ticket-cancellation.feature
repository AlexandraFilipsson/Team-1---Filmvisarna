/*Feature: Cancel booking
As a user, I want to be able to cancel a booking

//Background:
// Given that I am on the booked movie page

//Scenario: Non-member Cancelling Booking
/Given I am not currently logged into any account
/And I have the booking reference or confirmation email available
/When I access the cancellation link provided in the confirmation email or on the website
/Then I should be prompted to input the booking details for verification
//And after entering the required information
//When the system successfully verifies the booking
//And I proceed by clicking on the "Cancel" button
//Then I should encounter a confirmation dialogue
//And upon confirming the cancellation request
//Then I should expect to receive a cancellation email
//
